# About me
I am now working at Baidu VIS as an RD.  
My research interest is **3D vision**, including 3D object detection, depth estimation, stereo matching, point cloud semantic segmentation and NeRF.
I received my B.E degree from Wuhan University and my Ph.D. degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Xiaolin Zhang.
